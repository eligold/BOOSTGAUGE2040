<h1 align="center"> RP2040 LVGL Car OBD-II Gauge </h1>

Programatically generate gauges on a round touchscreen with LVGL for infite flexibility in what data is displayed and how.

This was going to be a relaxed weekend afternoon project that turned into an impromptu all-nighter. I'm documenting this as much to show off the results as I am to highlight the development pitfalls and highlight ways for others to avoid some of my own mistakes.

    I saw this video first, it is for a custom shift knob gear select indicator. While not the same screen it definitely got the creative gears turning so to speak. It is a video from a series detailing that extremely cool project and the creator [upir](https://www.youtube.com/@upir_upir) is worth a follow if you like cars and also gadgets.

    Using the meters widget from a port of lvgl v8 to programatically generate gauges, first one I stumbled upon like this. Shared no source code.

    Another set of gauges based on static images. Doesn't benefit from the configurability of lvgl instead using only the lower level TFT_eSPI driver.

    Another project based on images with more dynamic sprite utilization.

    This is a fun project for displaying animated images on the screen.

    Star wars tactical display is another fun diversion. Uses another lower-level graphics library and a dumb screen but the display elements are largely generated with code. Very neat project.
